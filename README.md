## :clipboard: About

*Psst: tem em [português](/README-pt.md) também!* :raising_hand_man:

This project was developed during Rocketseat's _Next Level Week_ (Impulse). The goal was to create a fully functional and accessible feedback widget for both web and mobile devices, following a [Figma Project](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1102912516166573468).

The mobile app built with React Native is in [another repository](https://github.com/gabrielcarloto/feedback-widget-mobile).
